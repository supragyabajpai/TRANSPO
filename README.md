## Problem:  
•	Manipal University Jaipur is situated around 15 – 18 kilometres away from the city, in a remote location.

•	Many students faced challenges in commuting to the main city, given that a significant number of them were from different parts of the country.

•	A communication barrier arose as students interacted with cab drivers who primarily spoke the local language.

•	Scarcity of cabs from popular ride-sharing services like Uber and Ola added to the transportation difficulties for students.

•	This resulted in a constant struggle for students, particularly before breaks when approximately 2500 students seek transportation to the railway station and the airport.

## Solution

A mobile app which will allow students to book a cab and connect with local drivers who prefer a regional app over industry giants like Uber and Ola, which charge hefty commissions for bookings. The app ensures students a consistent rate during peak times and provides local drivers with a larger commission.


## Pre-Launch (Apr 18 - Nov 18) : Team of Two

•	Conducted a market survey to analyse demand.

•	Held meetings with local drivers and their union, explaining the solution and formalizing a Memorandum of Understanding for their onboarding.

•	Developed an Android app and added driver details.

•	Created social media platforms to promote the app and outlined revenue generation strategies.
